                <p>I heard from others and you about how first experiences can suck, but you've given me the opposite.
                            You've taught me so many things in only a span of 3 years and it helped me learn more about myself,
                            how to be better, and how you've turned me into a better version of myself. You became my best friend,
                            my biggest suporter, my bodyguard, and someone so special to me. I have learn to enjoy and love the
                            simple things we do, and I hope that this never stops even when we live together. I can't wait to
                            learn new things with you (even when its just about medieval stuff..) and hopefully someday we'd be
                            together to achieve the future we both deserve.
                </p>
